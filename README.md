## Getting Started
1. You must have Java 8 Runtime Environment Installed
2. You must have Apache Tomcat 9.0 installed
3. You must have Spring Tool Suit 4 installed
4. You must have Git and GitBash command line tool installed

If you have all three prerequisites you can continue to cloning the project

Choose a folder you would like to place the project into
Right click on the folder and choose "Git Bash here", this will open the Git Bash command line tool
In the Git Bash terminal type this:
`git clone https://github.com/0947JavaReact/project-1---reimursement-app-elmcgill.git`
Hit enter and the project files will be downloaded onto your machine

After you have successfully cloned the project to your local machine, open up Spring Tool Suite
Once open, on the left side in the project panel right click and choose import
This will open a new window, under general select "Projects from Folder or Archive"
Choose the folder you cloned the project to, and you would now have the project imported into Spring Tool Suite
Now find the project on the left side of the screen and right click it
Choose properties, then targeted runtimes, make sure Apache Tomcat v9.0 is selected
You should now be ready to start running the project

## Usage

To start the application, you will still need to be in Spring Tool Suite
Right click on the project again, this time choose "Run As" then "Run on server"
This will start up the project, once its started up a new browser window should appear
When this window pops up, replace the url in the window with this url:
`http://localhost:8080/project1/resources/html/index.html`
Now you can use the application
